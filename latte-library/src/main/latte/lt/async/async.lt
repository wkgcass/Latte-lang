/*
Async is a library help you run async programs elegantly.
The library is buit for async programs but itself doesn't provide threads or thread pools.
It simply runs as a single-thread program, but the functions passed in might be from
a framework or library that maintains a thread pool. e.g. Vert.x event loop.
